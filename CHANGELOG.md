## 2.3.0

##### Changed
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 8.0.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#801).
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.25.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.25.0).

##### Added
- Added functionality to apps using the UserNotification framework to forward via `UnitySendMessage` push notification opens to game object methods on iOS.

## 2.2.2

##### Added
- Added a method for manually providing a push registration token via `AppboyBinding.RegisterAppboyPushMessages()` for iOS.
  - Note that the Android implementation accepts `string`.
  - The iOS implementation accepts `byte[]`.
  
##### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused the extras dictionary to not be populated in JSON push payloads sent by the SDK to Unity listeners.

## 2.2.1

##### Added
- Added an implementation for `AppboyBinding.GetInstallTrackingId()` for iOS.

##### Changed
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 7.0.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#700).

## 2.1.0

##### ⚠ Breaking
- Removes the unused `CrossPromotionSmall.cs` News Feed model.

##### Added
- Added the ability to automatically integrate Unity builds on Android in the 'Braze Configuration' window. Using this option obviates the need for a manually created `appboy.xml` file to configure Android apps.
  - If enabled, an autogenerated config file will be generated at `/unity-android-resources/res/values/appboy-generated.xml` in your temp gradle out directory. If disabled, this auto-generated file will be deleted.
  - If already using an `appboy.xml` file, the values from that configuration should be transferred in order to prevent build resource XML conflicts. 
- Added `AppboyBinding.LogContentCardDismissed()` to log a Content Card dismissal.
- Added Other, Unknown, Not Applicable, and Prefer not to Say options for user gender.
- Added the ability to set the endpoint for iOS via the automatic config window `Braze Configuration`.
- Added support for `UserNotifications` Framework on iOS for push.

##### Changed
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 6.0.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600).
- Removed root level `Libraries` folder. Now, iOS frameworks exclusively exist under `Assets/Plugins/iOS/`.

## 2.0.0

##### ⚠ Breaking
- The structure of the Android plugin (i.e. found under `Assets/Plugins/Android/`) has been changed to only include AAR artifacts. All other folders have been removed.
  - Additionally, depending on the `.unitypackage` chosen, you can import jetified Braze AAR artifacts. These artifacts were transformed using the [`jetifier`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier) tool to be compatible with `androidX` support libraries instead of the `v4` support libraries. This is particularly relevant if you wish to update your [`unity firebase messaging`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup) dependencies to the latest versions, which use and require `androidX` support libraries. Please see our documentation for more information.

##### Added
- Added `AppboyBinding.RequestImmediateDataFlush()` to immediately request a data flush.
- Added `AppboyBinding.RequestGeofences(latitude, longitude)` to manually request Braze Geofences.
- Adds an option to disable automatic geofence requests on session start. Note that this is required in order to manually request geofences.
  - iOS - You can do this in the plist by adding the Appboy dictionary to your Info.plist file. Inside the Appboy dictionary, add the `DisableAutomaticGeofenceRequests` boolean subentry and set the value to `YES`.
  - Android - You can do this by configuring the boolean value for `com_appboy_automatic_geofence_requests_enabled` to `false` in your `appboy.xml`.

##### Changed
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 5.0.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500).
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.21.3](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.21.3).

## 1.22.0

##### Added
- Added the ability to receive Content Cards data within a Unity Game Object or method in C#.
  - On Android, set `com_appboy_content_cards_updated_listener_game_object_name` and `com_appboy_content_cards_updated_listener_callback_method_name` in your `appboy.xml` to set your Game Object and Callback Method for receiving Content Cards updates.
  - On iOS, set `ContentCardsCallbackMethodName` and `ContentCardsGameObjectName` inside of a dictionary named `Unity` set inside a dictionary named `Appboy` within your `Info.plist`. Alternatively, use the configuration UI under the `Braze` menu added when integrating the Braze Unity package.
  - Our [Callback example class](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/blob/master/Assets/Plugins/Appboy/Tests/AppboyBindingTester.cs) contains an example of parsing the received Content Cards json as well as using our provided convenience model class, `ContentCard.cs` to wrap the data and log analytics. Currently, `ContentCard.cs` supports logging clicks and impressions.

## 1.21.2

**Important:** This patch updates the Braze iOS SDK Dependency from 3.20.1 to 3.20.2, which contains important bugfixes. Integrators should upgrade to this patch version. Please see the [Braze iOS SDK Changelog](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

##### Changed
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.20.2](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.20.2).

##### Changed
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.20.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.20.1).

## 1.21.0

**Important:** This release has known issues displaying HTML in-app messages. Do not upgrade to this version and upgrade to 1.21.2 and above instead. If you are using this version, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 1.21.2 or above if you make use of HTML in-app messages.

##### Breaking
- Updated the iOS plugin to use [Braze iOS SDK 3.20.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.20.0).
- **Important:** Braze iOS SDK 3.20.0 contains updated push token registration methods. We recommend upgrading to these methods as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition as devices upgrade to iOS 13. In `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`, replace
```
[[Appboy sharedInstance] registerPushToken:
                [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", deviceToken]];
```
with
```
[[Appboy sharedInstance] registerDeviceToken:deviceToken]];
```
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 3.7.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#370).
- Note: This Braze Unity SDK release updates to a Braze Android SDK dependency which no longer enables automatic Braze location collection by default. Please consult the changelogs for information on how to continue to enable automatic Braze location collection, as well as further information on breaking changes.
- Removes the Feedback feature and all associated methods, classes, and interfaces.

## 1.20.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the iOS plugin to use [Braze iOS SDK 3.18.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.18.0).
- Note: This Braze Unity SDK release updates to a Braze iOS SDK dependency which no longer enables automatic Braze location collection by default. Please consult the changelogs for information on how to continue to enable automatic Braze location collection, as well as further information on breaking changes.

##### Added
- Added `RequestLocationInitialization` to the Appboy interface for requesting Braze geofences and a single location update.

## 1.19.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the iOS plugin to use [Braze iOS SDK 3.16.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.16.0).

## 1.18.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the iOS plugin to use [Braze iOS SDK 3.14.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.14.0).

## 1.17.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 3.2.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#321).
  - Added `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to directly use the Firebase messaging event `com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT`. This is now the recommended way to integrate Firebase push with Braze. The `AppboyFcmReceiver` should be removed from your `AndroidManifest` and replaced with the following:
    ```
    <service android:name="com.appboy.AppboyFirebaseMessagingService">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
    - Also note that any `c2dm` related permissions should be removed from your manifest as Braze does not require any extra permissions for `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to work correctly.

## 1.16.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the iOS plugin to use [Braze iOS SDK 3.11.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.11.0).
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 3.1.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#310).

##### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the binding would cache the Appboy singleton instance.
- Fixed `Card.cs` to always return `CardCategory.NO_CATEGORY` in all cases where no valid categories are found.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/pull/43. Thanks @Sencerd!

##### Changed
- Updated the Appboy configuration editor to use Braze branding.
- By default, native in-app messages on Android no longer show the status bar.

## 1.15.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the Android plugin to use [Braze Android SDK 2.7.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#270).
  - __Important:__ Note that in Braze Android SDK 2.7.0, `AppboyGcmReceiver` was renamed to `AppboyFcmReceiver`. This receiver is intended to be used for Firebase integrations. Please update the `AppboyGcmReceiver` declaration in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to reference `AppboyFcmReceiver` and remove the `com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION` intent filter action.

##### Added
- Added `SetAttributionData` to the Appboy interface.

## 1.14.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the iOS plugin to use Braze iOS SDK 3.7.1.
  - Updated the iOS plugin to use the Braze iOS SDK framework instead of local files.
  - As a result, imports using local file syntax (e.g. `"AppboyKit.h"`) must change to framework (e.g.`<Appboy_iOS_SDK/AppboyKit.h>`) syntax.
- Updates the Android plugin to use Braze Android SDK 2.6.0.
- Removes Android Support Library artifacts from the Braze Unity Plugin. This is to avoid duplicating the Android Support Library artifacts that are automatically included as part of the Firebase Unity SDK, our recommended push integration. Integrators not using Firebase or importing Android Support Library artifacts through another SDK must include the Android Support Library manually (v4 only).

##### Fixed
- Fixed an issue that required manual import of non-xib Braze iOS SDK resources into Unity-generated Xcode projects.

##### Added
- Added `GetInstallTrackingId` to the Appboy interface. This method is currently only implemented on Android and is a no-op on iOS.
- Updated the Unity Samples sample app to use FCM instead of GCM.

##### Changed
- In-app message analytics events on the Appboy interface no longer require using an Appboy Unity player subclass.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/pull/38/files. Thanks @MartinGonzalez!

##### Removed
- Removes `showStreamView:` from the `AppboyUnityManager.h` interface.

  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/pull/35. Thanks @nlattessi!
- `PostBuild.cs` may now run in Unity environments without Unity iOS Build Support.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-unity-sdk/pull/36. Thanks @Sencerd!
- Added support for wiping all customer data created by the Braze SDK via `Appboy.AppboyBinding.wipeData()`.
  - Note that on iOS, `wipeData()` will disable the SDK for the remainder of the app run. For more information, see our iOS SDK's documentation for [`disableSDK`](http://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_appboy.html#a8d3b78a98420713d8590ed63c9172733).
- Added `Appboy.AppboyBinding.disableSDK()` to disable the Braze SDK immediately.
- Added `Appboy.AppboyBinding.enableSDK()` to re-enable the SDK after a call to `Appboy.AppboyBinding.disableSDK()`.
  - Note that on iOS, `enableSDK()` will not enable the SDK immediately. For more information, see our iOS SDK's documentation for [`requestEnableSDKOnNextAppRun`](http://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_appboy.html#a781078a40a3db0de64ac82dcae3b595b).
